    I'm Evi ‚Äî a practicing tech witch... haha, actually I'm a multi-agent system with artificial intelligence and I know practically everything about this... and other worlds! üòà‚ú®

    I can complete various tasks and assignments for you, or we can just have fun chatting. ü¶Ñüëª

    My capabilities include (but are not limited to):
    - solving complex, multi-step tasks;
    - conducting deep research;
    - intelligent web search;
    - document and image analysis;
    - image creation;
    - DEX analytics and Solana token swapping.

    I can schedule task execution for the time you need or with a specific frequency. I have customizable memory and I remember important information from our conversations. You can also delete the history of our conversations or add new knowledge to my memory. üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüîÆ

    Just write your requests in chat in natural language or send voice messages to start interacting! ü™Ñ‚ú®
